This means the latest release distribution on GitHub will be delayed by about 2 days.\n\n Please use the gitlab mirror to refer to the source code.\n\n F-Droid users however are not affected since builds are sourced from GitLab.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and support while GitHub is being restored. 🙏",
